📝 Incident Report – Malware Detection (Week 2)
1. Overview

A malware simulation was performed using the EICAR test file to evaluate endpoint detection and SIEM monitoring.

Windows Defender detected the threat and generated alerts that were analyzed in Splunk.

2. Environment

OS: Windows 10 VM

SIEM: Splunk Enterprise

Antivirus: Windows Defender

Simulation: EICAR

3. Detection

Event ID: 1116

Source: Windows Defender

Location: Defender Operational Logs

Threat was detected immediately after execution.

4. Analysis

Splunk was configured to ingest Defender logs.

Query used:

index=* EventCode=1116


Logs were analyzed for timestamps, file paths, and response actions.

5. Response

Malware quarantined

System scanned

Logs reviewed

No further compromise detected

6. Challenges

Log permission restrictions

Manual SIEM onboarding

These were resolved by modifying file access permissions.

7. Lessons Learned

Importance of endpoint monitoring

Proper SIEM configuration

Log correlation techniques

8. Conclusion

This project improved practical knowledge of malware detection and incident response using SIEM tools.
